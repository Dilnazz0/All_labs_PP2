#There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:
#List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
#Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
#Set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members.
#Dictionary is a collection which is ordered** and changeable. No duplicate members.

#Create and print a dictionary:

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
print(thisdict)

#Print the "brand" value of the dictionary:

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
print(thisdict["brand"])

#Duplicate values заменяют имеющиеся:

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964,
  "year": 2020
}
print(thisdict)
#To determine how many items a dictionary has, use the len() function:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964,
  "year": 2020
}
print(len(thisdict))
#The values in dictionary items can be of any data type:
#type()
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
print(type(thisdict))
#dict()
#Using the dict() method to make a dictionary:

thisdict = dict(name = "John", age = 36, country = "Norway")
print(thisdict)
#Accessing Items
#Get the value of the "model" key:

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
x = thisdict["model"]
#get()
x = thisdict.get("model")
#keys()
#Get a list of the keys:

x = thisdict.keys()

#Add a new item to the original dictionary, and see that the keys list gets updated as well:

car = {
"brand": "Ford",
"model": "Mustang",
"year": 1964
}

x = car.keys()

print(x) #before the change

car["color"] = "white"

print(x) #after the change

#values()
#Get a list of the values:

x = thisdict.values()
#Make a change in the original dictionary, and see that the values list gets updated as well:

car = {
"brand": "Ford",
"model": "Mustang",
"year": 1964
}

x = car.values()

print(x) #before the change

car["year"] = 2020

print(x) #after the change

#Get a list of the key:value pairs
# items()
x = thisdict.items()
#Make a change in the original dictionary, and see that the items list gets updated as well:

car = {
"brand": "Ford",
"model": "Mustang",
"year": 1964

#Check if "model" is present in the dictionary:

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
if "model" in thisdict:
  print("Yes, 'model' is one of the keys in the thisdict dictionary")

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}

#pop()
#The pop() method removes the item with the specified key name:

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
thisdict.pop("model")
print(thisdict)

  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
thisdict.clear()
